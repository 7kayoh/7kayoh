# Welcome!

Heyo, I am va1kio, also known as nana_kon. I am a programmer and a UI designer working for the Roblox platform, providing better solution to solve user experience issues and enchancing games to be the next level. Apart from that, I also work on stuff outside of Roblox, I know languages like Swift, C, C#, et cetera. However, I will not be contributing to any repositories that is not related to Roblox as to keep stuff clean and not cluttered.
